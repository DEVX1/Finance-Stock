##About the Sample
[The Finance Dashboard sample](http://igniteui.com/application-samples#finance) sample demonstrates the data chart, combo, dialog, and zoom bar controls for the Financial Services industry. The data chart is optimized for high-speed financial charting. This sample uses large datasets with millions of data points and real-time updates. The data chart enables key statistical and technical indicators and comparisons to key competitors. To change chart type click on the "chart" button in the top right corner and choose desired chart type. If you want to change company ticker click on the button next to company name. In the finance dashboard sample you could also observe many different indicator types presented with the second chard in the app. Bellow them there is a volume chart and in the very bottom there is a zoombar with which you can easily zoom the main chart into different areas that are points of interest for you.
